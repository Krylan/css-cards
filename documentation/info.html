        <h1>CSS Cards by <b>Krylan</b></h1>
		Thanks for your interest in this project.<br />
		It includes one CSS file with rules for making a full classical card deck with animations and cards arrangements.<br />
		It has easy to edit variables, which define size, shadows and corner rounding for your cards.<br /><br />
		If you have any questions or comments, you can contact me on <a href="https://krylan.ovh/portfolio/" target="_blank">my portfolio</a>.
		
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		To start with CSS Cards it's good to make general div containing all card elements (hands, decks etc.).<br /> For set of cards used for classical games I'm giving class 'classic-playset'.<br /> Inside, we can arrange set of cards in various formations – defined by me are 'hand' and 'deck'.<br /> You can also turn cards back with animations just by adding or removing 'back' class to the 'card' element.<br /><br />
		Inside card you can make div with attributes 'data-suit' and 'data-rank'.<br /> These two are responsible for corner marks of cards.<br /> In 'data-suit' there are defined following values: [hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, red, black].<br /> First four are defining symbol, which is showed below rank of card – next two are for color-only (for example for jokers).<br />
		In 'data-rank' you can write anything you want.<br /> It depends on you, which symbols you want on cards. It's also displayed in corners of card.<br />
		Inside of this div element you can write a symbol, which is displayed on center of card, or attach a background-image for a card (to do so, you need to add new rule for specific card with 'background-image' rule only).<br /><br />
		You can, of course, make a custom card set with this CSS file. I would be really happy to see new creations and other uses of this project.

		<div class="classic-playset" style="margin-top:50px;height:200px;">
			<card class="back" onclick="this.classList.toggle('back')">
				<div data-suit="red" data-rank="&#9733;">&#9733;</div>
			</card>
		</div>
		<br style="clear:both" />
		<h3>Demo 1</h3>
		Just click on the card and see what you got.<br /> All you need to do to get this effect is toggle class 'back' for 'card' element.<br /> For example, for 'onclick' event do "this.classList.toggle('back');".
		<br /><br />
</pre>
		
		<div class="classic-playset" style="height:300px;">
		<div class="hand" style="top:100px;">
			<card>
				<div data-suit="hearts" data-rank="6">&hearts;</div>
			</card>
			<card>
				<div data-suit="spades" data-rank="K">&#9818;</div>
			</card>
			<card>
				<div data-suit="diamonds" data-rank="2">&#9830;</div>
			</card>
		</div>
		</div>
		<br style="clear:both" />
		<h3>Demo 2</h3>
		In this demo I used three cards in 'hand' formation. In this formation cards on hover are exposed to the player.
		<br /><br />
		Code:<br />
		<pre>
<div class="classic-playset">
	<div class="hand">
		<card>
			<div data-suit="hearts" data-rank="6">&hearts;</div>
		</card>
		<card>
			<div data-suit="spades" data-rank="K">&#9818;</div>
		</card>
		<card>
			<div data-suit="diamonds" data-rank="2">&#9830;</div>
		</card>
	</div>
</div>
</pre>

		<div class="classic-playset" style="height:300px;">
		<div class="deck" style="top:100px;">
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
			<card class="back"></card>
		</div>
		</div>
		<br style="clear:both" />
		<h3>Demo 3</h3>
		Now I used second formation called a 'deck'. Cards are stacked in a pile, so players can draw new cards.<br />
		You can stock them as much as you want and you can see how many cards are in the deck.<br /> To make cards turned back, you need to use class 'back' on 'card' element.
		<br /><br />
		Code:<br />
		<pre>
<div class="classic-playset">
	<div class="deck">
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
		<card class="back"></card>
	</div>
</div>
</pre>
		Note, that content of 'card' elements are empty. I can't let players cheat using developer console, right?
